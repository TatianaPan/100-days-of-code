### Day 2: November 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed problems on my photography portfolio project: now it is rendered correctly by Safari as well.

**Thoughts:**: I was happy to learn how to render images correctly in Safari + how to add sticky header.

### Day 3: November 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did basic setup for a project of my fellow colleague from coding bootcamp. I will help him with frontend. So created react app and setup redux, etc, fetched first data from fake API to test.
+ starting with Ruby on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** It was good to re-read materials on redux - now it makes much more sense than during bootcamp.

Project is developing on gitlab in private repo.
